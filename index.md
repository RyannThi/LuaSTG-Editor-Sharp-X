LuaSTG Editor Sharp X is a clone/fork of LuaSTG Editor Sharp aimed towards improving the original with new functions and altered behaviour, providing more ease of support for LuaSTG ExPlus and LuaSTG-x and in active development, open to feedback and suggestions.

So we decided to start this project to add new features we felt like Sharp could have and also edit some existing nodes to add more functionality to them. You can see all the changes we did in the pages on the left!

We are also open to suggestions so feel free to ask stuff in this formulary: https://forms.gle/9X7y6TBoHaF22XcZ8

I, the main developer for this, am not very experienced in C# and WPF (in fact, this is my first time using Visual Studio!), but I've been doing my best to implement features that people have requested while also using this project as a learning tool! I am mostly a LuaSTG coder, but I felt like I could contribute more to the community by modifying this program. Alongside this project, for a brief history of mine, I am also the founder of the LuaSTG wiki (http://en.luastg.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page), made tutorials for LuaSTG (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxTCWJk5biy3EEA2O_MjUTxwNcaQMV3tS) and created a THlib Asset Replacement Package, Ryannlib (https://ryann1908.itch.io/ryannlib).
